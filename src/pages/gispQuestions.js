    "options": [
      "Scale bars show true north; RF shows magnetic declination",
      "A scale bar remains accurate when the map is resized; RF becomes incorrect",
      "RF is used for large-scale maps; scale bars only for small-scale maps",
      "Scale bars apply only to projected maps"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "A graphic scale bar resizes proportionally with the map, so it remains accurate even when the map is printed at different sizes. A representative fraction (e.g., 1:24,000) becomes incorrect if the map is reproduced at a different scale."

    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "When circles represent quantities, the symbol area (not radius) should be proportional to the data value. Flannery proposed a perceptual correction because humans systematically underestimate the size of larger circles."
